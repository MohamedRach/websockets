The real-time order tracking app is an application that leverages web sockets to provide users with live updates on their orders. Built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO.

Users can receive real-time updates as their orders progress through different stages. The app utilizes web sockets, powered by Socket.IO, to establish a persistent connection between the client and server. This enables instant communication and enables the server to push order status updates to the client in real time.

When an admin updates the order status from the administration dashboard, the change is instantly reflected in real time for the client. eliminating the need for manual refreshes or constant status checks.
